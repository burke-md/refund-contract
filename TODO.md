- [ ] splitting the require statements into two, you can save gas (you can double check this with

- [ ] admin will be a storage read, and we already know admin will be calling via the modifier, so if we use msg.sender it will save gas L: 264

- [ ] Since the code is so similar in the tests when you are testing different Week 5/15 etc scenarios, how about abstract these into helper functions? L:302

- [ ] Functions that are onlyAdmin can be made payable because presumably the admin wonâ€™t be stupid enough to send ether in those transactions. This will save a little gas also
